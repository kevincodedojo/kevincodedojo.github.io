            <h2>What is agile methodology</h2>
            <p>Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid response to change. It is based on the Agile Manifesto, which prioritizes individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change over rigid processes and comprehensive documentation.</p> 
            <p>Key practices include breaking work into small iterations (sprints), frequent delivery of working products, and continuous feedback loops to adapt the plan as needed.</p>
